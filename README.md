Throughout this project, I gained proficiency in:
- Drawing schematics.
- Creating components, drafting schematic symbols, and designing footprints.
- Placing components onto the PCB.
- Routing the PCB.
- Generating a 3D model to visualize the board's physical structure.
- Crafting a comprehensive Bill of Materials (BOM) for component procurement.
- Generating assembly drawings detailing component placement on the board.
- Generating manufacturing files such as Gerber, Pick and Place, and Drill files.
- Preparing professional documentation required for PCB manufacturing and board assembly.
